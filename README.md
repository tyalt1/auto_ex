## Documentation

### Signal

A signal is an event that triggers all actions linked to it.

```elixir
alias AutoEx.Signal

{:ok, pid} = Signal.start_link()
Signal.run(pid)
```

### Action

An action is a stand alone function.

```elixir
alias AutoEx.Action

action = Action.new(fn -> IO.puts "Performing action!" end)
Action.run(action)
```

### Link Signal with Actions

When an action is added to a signal, it is run whenever the signal is.

```elixir
alias AutoEx.{Signal, Action}

{:ok, signal} = Signal.start_link()
action = Action.new(fn -> IO.puts "Performing action!" end)
Signal.add_action(signal, action)
Singal.run(signal)
```

### Resource

Advantages on Resource:
- crud semantics
- persistance

## TODO
- Tests!
- Action retry
- Logging when signal is fired
- Logging when action is executed (successful/failure)
- persistance for resource
- documenting resource
